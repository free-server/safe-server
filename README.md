## Overview
> Generated by AugmentCode

Augment just finished syncing with your codebase! Here is a summary of what we saw:

This is "safe-server", an automated server setup project that installs and configures multiple proxy/VPN services on Ubuntu servers, including:

- ShadowsocksR (SSR) for encrypted proxy connections
- HTTP/2 proxy using nghttpx and squid
- Optional Cisco AnyConnect VPN (Ocserv)

Key features:

- Automated installation script (`install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh`)
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificate integration
- User management scripts for creating/deleting users
- Auto-update functionality
- Service monitoring and auto-restart via cron jobs
- Client setup tutorials for various platforms (iOS/Android/Windows/Mac)
- QR code generation for easy mobile client configuration
- The project is designed for easy deployment on cloud providers like AWS EC2, Vultr, Linode, or Azure, requiring minimal manual configuration. It includes automatic TCP optimization options and supports multiple users per server with connection speed limitations.

The primary use case appears to be providing secure internet access, with an emphasis on reliability and ease of maintenance through automated monitoring and updates.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Amazon EC2 / Vultr / Linode or Microsoft Azure;
* Ubuntu Server 16-20 (14 LTS may work as well)
* RAM 1Gb+; SSD Drive is preferred.
* [IMPORTANT] Firewall inbound: TCP 22, 25, 80, 443 and all ports you want to use in SSR / HTTP2. Say 10000-30000
* Firewall outbound: all ports
* A Domain 
  - Domain A record is pointing to the Ubuntu server IP (IPV4)
  - Domain MX Record set to correct smtp server, say `smtp.secureserver.net`
  - Domain TXT Record set to `v=spf1 mx -all` ([SPF](https://hk.godaddy.com/en/help/add-an-spf-record-19218))

### Average usage

```bash
sudo su
rm -f install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
wget --no-cache -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/free-server/safe-server/master/install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
bash install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
```

### Moderate users (count of users served per server)

```bash
sudo su
rm -f install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
wget --no-cache -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/free-server/safe-server/master/install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
bash install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh 5

# 5 means this server only serves 5 users (by default it counts from current user list)
# It matters with connection speed limitation
```

### With CISCO AnyConnect VPN (Ocserv OpenConnect)

```bash
sudo su

echo "export isToInstallOcservCiscoAnyConnect=1" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc

rm -f install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
wget --no-cache -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/free-server/safe-server/master/install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
bash install-shadowsocks-spdy.sh
```

Note that, the script could be redeployed/reinstalled on your Ubuntu without worries on losing any old Shadowsocks-R and HTTP/2 account or password.
It backs them up if found any before execute re-installation.

### Do not take 443 and 80
```bash
sudo su
echo "export miscWebsitePortHttps=8443" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export miscWebsitePortHttp=8080" >> ~/.bashrc
```
 - This is to use port 8443 and 8080 instead 443 and 80;
- Make sure you enable those ports you assigned in your Firewall.

## Alternative TCP Optimized Installation (Chinese)
Google: [TCP BBR](https://doub.io/wlzy-16/)

## Create User

```bash
# Assume you didn't change $freeServerRoot

# Shadowsocks-r+HTTP2 VPN:
sudo /opt/free-server/git-repo/free-server/bin/createuser.sh User Pass ShadowsocksRPort HTTP2Port EmailAddress

# e.g.
sudo /opt/free-server/git-repo/free-server/bin/createuser.sh test1 test123 10000 10401 SOME_SOME_USER@qq.com

```

* Once user created, shell script will echo back ShadowsocksR QR Code scheme and its web link,
which includes all the user credentials and configurations for your clients (iOS/Android/Windows SSR Client) to import.

## How to setup clients

* ShadowsocksR default settings:

```bash
export shadowsocksREncrypt="aes-256-cfb"
export shadowsocksRObfuscate="tls1.2_ticket_auth"
export shadowsocksRProtocol="auth_sha1_v4"
export shadowsocksRObfuscateParam="s3.amazonaws.com"
```

* HTTP2

After you created a user, you should know.

## Delete User

```bash
# Assume you didn't change $freeServerRoot

# Shadowsocks-r+HTTP2 VPN:
sudo /opt/free-server/git-repo/free-server/bin/deleteuser.sh User Pass ShadowsocksRPort HTTP2Port SOME_SOME_USER@qq.com

# e.g.
sudo /opt/free-server/git-repo/free-server/bin/deleteuser.sh test1 test123 10000 10401 SOME_SOME_USER@qq.com

```

## Client setup

* After User created, you should see Terminal echo with client setup guide

## GL.iNet Router with custom OpenWRT 
* GL.iNet smart routers
* Enter UBoot 
  * Connect GL.iNet LAN to the secondary WiFi router WAN
  * Make sure the secondary WiFi router LAN use 10.0.0.1
  * Power on, immediately press Reset until the light is steady white
  * Visit 192.168.1.1 for the UBoot flush UI
* Flush https://openwrt.ai/?target=ramips%2Fmt7621&id=glinet_gl-mt1300 to support ShadowsocksR (built-in SSR Plus or PassWall, etc.)


## Caveats

* OpenSSL will be upgraded to 1.1.1a
* A bunch of scripts will be added into /etc/cron.d/ for monitoring safe-server service
* Let's Encrypt TLS Certs will be applied for your domain
* Safe server will be automatically up-to-date monthly

## Change Logs

* [INFO] - 05/01/2019 - [enhancement] - Add gfwlis-banAD.acl for ssr android
* [INFO] - 02/01/2019 - [enhancement] - Upgrade nghttpx to 1.35.1 to support TLS1.3 0-RTT for faster connection
* [INFO] - 13/12/2018 - [feature] - Add auto update free-server itself monthly
* [INFO] - Remove SPDYLay, only keeping HTTP/2 as Chrome supports HTTP/2 well
